A *graph* is a network of vertices (also called nodes) and edges.  The edges
indicate relationships between vertices.

*Example*: A social network is a graph whose vertices are people.  What
 should the edges represent?

In graph theory we're interested in the structures of graphs and their
properties.  One important type of property is whether or not we can travel
all of the edges without retracing any.

*Activity 1*: For the given graphs, try to find a way to trace the graph
 without tracing over an edge more than once.  See if you can find the
 pattern!  There is one, but it's a little tricky to spot...
| Graph | start | end |
|-------+-------+-----|
| /     | <     | >   |
|       |       |     |
|       |       |     |
|       |       |     |
|       |       |     |
|       |       |     |
|       |       |     |
Another important property is /planarity/, which means that we can draw the
graph without intersecting edges.

*Activity 2*: For the given graphs, try to determine if they are planar or
 not.
| Graph | Planar? |
|-------+---------|
| /     | <>      |
|       |         |
|       |         |
|       |         |
|       |         |
|       |         |
|       |         |
*Activity 3*: The vertices, edges and faces of a planar graph satisfy a
 certain relationship.  Can you find it?
| Graph | V | E | F |
|-------+---+---+---|
| /     | < |   | > |
|       |   |   |   |
|       |   |   |   |
|       |   |   |   |
|       |   |   |   |
|       |   |   |   |
|       |   |   |   |

*Example*: A chemical company sells seven different chemicals to consumers.
 Some of these chemicals are known to interact dangerously with each other,
 and so they shouldn't be in the same shipment.  The chemicals and
 interactions are given by the following table:
| chemical | interactions         |
|----------+----------------------|
| /        | <>                   |
| $c_1$    | $c_2, c_4, c_6$      |
| $c_2$    | $c_1, c_7$           |
| $c_3$    | $c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7  |
| $c_4$    | $c_1, c_3$           |
| $c_5$    | $c_3, c_6$           |
| $c_6$    | $c_1, c_3, c_5, c_7$ |
| $c_7$    | $c_2, c_3, c_6$      |


The previous problem can be solved using graph colorings.  The goal with
setting up a graph coloring is to use as few colors as possible.

*Example*: How many colors do you need to color a planar graph?  Try some
 examples!
